### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I an Lisa
A wearer of many hats ðŸ‘’ whose curiosity about how things work serves as a constant inspiration to learn new skills. Among other things, it has led me to discover
- Data science and data engineering ðŸ¤– (I just graduated from Le Wagon's Data Science & AI bootcamp)
- Implementing and migrating data to open source library service platform FOLIO ðŸ’»
- Promoting free access to information as a librarian ðŸ“š

Having started my own programming journey while I was working as a librarian and often had to deal with large datasets, I am passionate about braking down perceived barriers to technology and making coding - as a tool or as a career - accessible to more people.
